            <h2>About Faithworks</h2>
            <p>Faithworks is a joint initiative of parishes with Presbyterian affiliations in Hamilton – though it is ecumenical in its orientation. Its launch is planned for early 2026. Its motto is <i>“CONNECTING FAITH AND LIFE.”</i> It will offer a variety of learning opportunities: short courses, with separate tracks for adults and youth (once-weekly classes for durations of 5-6 weeks); Saturday or weekend workshops or retreats; and a Monday-Friday (daytime) Summer Gathering for all ages.</p>
            <p>Faithworks is physically based at St Andrews Presbyterian Church, due to its central location and extensive facilities, but some learning events may be held at other participating churches.</p>
            <p>A leadership team consists of volunteer representatives from participating parishes, including a separate youth council. Teachers of courses and facilitators of other learning events are drawn from both clergy and laity with expertise in the particular learning events being offered.</p>
            <p>A minimal fee for each course or learning event is suggested, to cover the costs of course materials, publicity, and other operating expenses, but participants can offer a koha based on their own needs.</p>
            <p>All learning events are open to the public and ecumenical in nature.</p>
            <p>The teaching-learning approach is learner-centred, interactive, and focused on making real-world connections between content and application.</p>
